model should have process_command(command& cmd) where it takes in a command from the cmd_receiver task and has a switch statement which processes each type of command

for example if we get a set_gear_cmd we first have to check if we are grounded, and if we are we log an error that invalid command was sent, and then discard the command

if the command is valid we then set the actua
